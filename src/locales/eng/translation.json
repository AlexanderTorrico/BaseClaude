By using the Service, you agree to comply with all trade sanctions, import and export laws and regulations, and you represent and warrant that: i) you are not prohibited from accessing the Service, and ii) you will not provide the Service to any person prohibited from accessing it under any applicable laws or regulations.\n d. Dispute Resolution. If you have any dispute arising from these Terms, please contact us here, and we will attempt to work with you to resolve it. If we cannot resolve a dispute with you, both you and Aziende agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding injunctive or equitable relief sought by Aziende) arising from or related to these Terms and/or the Service (collectively, 'Claims') through binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at that time, unless otherwise provided in these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted via videoconference or at a location mutually agreed upon and reasonably convenient for both parties. Each party will be responsible for paying the AAA's filing, administrative, and arbitration fees in accordance with the AAA rules. The arbitrator's award may include the cost of arbitration, reasonable attorney's fees, and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses. The award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in court as necessary to prevent actual or imminent breach, misappropriation, or infringement of data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights. The parties shall bring any Claim in their individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitrator or jury may not consolidate the claims of more than one person. You agree that by entering into this agreement, both you and Aziende waive the right to a jury trial and to participate in a class action. Both you and Aziende agree that any jury trial Claim in the United States for any reason must be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida or in the state courts of Florida in Pinellas County.\n e. Contracting Entity of Aziende. The Aziende entity with which you enter into this contract under these Terms and the address to which you should send legal documents will depend on your billing address.\n If your billing address is in the United States: The Aziende entity entering into these Terms is Comerx LLC. Legal notices should be sent to 7901 4th St N Ste 300, St. Petersburg, FL 33702, United States. Attn: Legal\n If your billing address is in a country other than the United States or the United Kingdom: The Aziende entity entering into these Terms is Comerx LLC. Legal notices should be sent to 7901 4th St N Ste 300, St. Petersburg, FL 33702, United States. Attn: Legal\n f. Purchase through a Reseller. If you purchase the Service through an authorized distributor or reseller ('Reseller'), these Terms apply to your use of the Service unless you have signed another agreement with Aziende for this use. The Reseller will be responsible for billing, so Section 8 (Billing) will not apply. Resellers are not authorized to act or make commitments on behalf of Aziende, and unless otherwise stated in a separate agreement between you and Aziende, Aziende will have no obligations other than those expressed in these Terms.\n g. Assignment. You will not assign these Terms or any rights acquired under them without Aziende's consent, except in cases of merger, acquisition, or change in control structure. Aziende may transfer or assign any of its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice.\n i. Severability. If any specific provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will not be affected, and the Terms will be interpreted as if the invalid or unenforceable provision were limited or omitted to the minimum necessary.\n j. Waiver. Aziende's express waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a present or future waiver of such provisions and will not affect Aziende's ability to enforce any provision at a later time.\n k. Notices. All required notices will be sent to you at the email address associated with your account or through other means permitted by law.\n l. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). We respect the intellectual property rights of artists and content owners. We will respond to any notice of alleged copyright infringement submitted under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). For more information, please read our Intellectual Property Policy.\n n. Changes to These Terms. We may modify these Terms (as well as any policies, contracts, or agreements referenced herein) at any time. The most current version of these Terms will always be posted on the Aziende website. We will provide you with sufficient advance notice of any changes to the Terms that we believe may materially and negatively affect your rights or use of the Service. We may send you this notice through the Service itself and/or via email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to use the Service after the modified Terms take effect, you agree to comply with the new Terms.\n o. Changes to the Service. Aziende may add, modify, or remove features or functionalities of the Service, as well as modify or introduce storage or other feature limitations, and discontinue the Service in its entirety at any time. If you have a paid subscription and Aziende discontinues the Service you are using during your subscription period, Aziende will either switch you to or provide access to a substantially similar service provided by Aziende (if available). If it cannot do so, Aziende will refund a proportional portion of the prepaid fees corresponding to the remaining period of your subscription.\n p. Entire Agreement. These Terms, along with the agreements and policies referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and Aziende regarding the Service. These Terms supersede any prior representations, contracts, or agreements between you and Aziende, whether written or oral, regarding the Service, including previous versions of these Terms. The English version of these Terms will prevail over all other versions.",

  "Pp_subtitle_2": "1. General information",
  "Pp_paragraph_2": "Aziende has created this privacy statement to demonstrate its commitment to its users. The goal is that, through transparent and easy-to-understand information about our data practices, our users understand what data we collect, why we do it, and what we do with it. \n This policy applies to all brands, websites, applications, products, services, or technologies of Aziende (collectively referred to as \"Services\"). \n a. Information Collection: Account Level \n At the account level, we collect and use the information necessary to allow you to purchase and manage Services, provide you with support for such Services, and optimize your experience with us. Some of the information is collected and used based on contractual consent, and others are based on informed consent, which can be modified at any time. \n b. Basic Account Information. \n Information Collected. Our site uses forms in which you provide us with contact information (such as your name, address, phone number, fax number, billing information, IP address, and email address) so that you can create an account, place orders, register domains, request information, and request technical support. By using your account, we may also collect technical support requests and other information related to the management of your account and the Services you offer us. \n Legal Requirement. This type of information is legally or contractually necessary to be able to purchase and use the Services. For example, we are required to verify this type of information when our payment processor requests it. It is also necessary to be able to send you legal notifications and is mandatory for certain Services we offer. Additionally, some Services, such as domains, require this information for their purchase. If you purchase a domain from us, we are legally obligated to collect and retain this information. Furthermore, we are required to verify that the information provided is accurate and to send you legally required notifications regarding your domain(s). Consent for the collection, use, and retention of this information for these purposes is considered contractually granted during the use of such Service and any legally required retention period. \n c. How We Use This Information. \n Sending Emails. Legally Mandatory. As mentioned above, we use email to communicate with you, confirm your orders, send you the information you have requested, and send you legally or contractually required communications. Legally mandatory emails include verification emails required by ICANN, renewal notices, and any other policy or procedure created by ICANN governing the purchase of domains. Additionally, the law may require us to send you notifications, such as DMCA takedown notices, UDRP notifications, etc. Or, we may consider a change in one of our policies to be substantial and, therefore, determine the obligation (although not a legal requirement) to inform you of such change. This type of communication is not included in any of our opt-out procedures. \n Sending Emails: Service Communications and Promotional Communications. We may also use this information when it is important to contact you regarding changes in the functionality of the Services you have acquired or our website, and to provide you with customer service (\"Service Communications\"). By creating an account with us or acquiring our Services, you agree to receive this type of communication and acknowledge that they are not optional. We also use this information to share details about new services and special offers that we believe will be useful to you (\"Promotional Communications\"). You can choose not to receive Promotional Communications (or accept them, depending on your country of residence) through the preferences in your account panel or by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the email communication. \n Legally Required Disclosure. We will never share your information without your permission or in any way other than described in this policy. The only exceptions to this are when the law requires it, when we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with the law, or when we must comply with a legal process. Examples of these exceptions are court orders, subpoenas, and UDRP/URS processes. In each of these situations, we will carefully review the provided documentation and only comply if such documentation meets the required legal standards. \n Changes in Our Practices. If we modify our information handling practices or other privacy aspects, we will post such changes in this privacy statement. If we make any substantial changes, we will notify you through a notice on this site before the change takes effect, and we may also attempt to notify you by email about the privacy changes, if necessary. \n d. Retention and Deletion of Account Information. \n Personal Information After Account Cancellation. When your Aziende account is canceled (voluntarily or involuntarily), all your personally identifiable information is deactivated in our corresponding databases. However, you should know that deactivating your account does not mean that your personally identifiable information has been completely removed from our database. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information, if necessary, to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or as required by laws or regulations. Therefore, it may not be immediately deleted upon your request and constitutes an approved exception to the deletion rights under GDPR and CCPA. By creating an account with us, using our support services, or acquiring Services, you acknowledge and agree to these retention terms. \n e. Information Collection: Site Usage \n Device Information. We collect information from your devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.), such as your IP address and cookie information, to recognize them and send you legal notices (if your country of residence requires it), support services (when you contact our support team), and personalized experiences on our website and emails.

  "Pp_paragraph_4": "Our site has security measures in place to protect the information under our control from loss, misuse, and alteration. We use 128-bit SSL security to encrypt any transmission when you provide credit card information, personal data, and so on. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. a.

We do not knowingly collect, use, or share information that could reasonably be used to identify minors under the age of 18 without prior parental consent or in accordance with applicable law. b. Data Processing and Transfer: By using or interacting with any of our services, you consent to the processing, sharing, transfer, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Regardless of your country of residence, you acknowledge that you are directly transferring your data to our servers located in the United States and consent to processing within the United States, where Aziende processes your data. You also authorize us to transfer, process, store, and use your information in countries other than your own, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and to provide you with Services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your country of residence. By using our Services, you consent to our transfer of information about you to these countries. c. Compliance with legal, regulatory, and law enforcement requests: We cooperate with government, law enforcement, and private entities to enforce the law.

To the extent permitted by law, we may take reasonable steps to notify you if we are compelled to provide your personal information to third parties as part of a legal process. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN, registry, or ccTLD rules, regulations, and policies when you register a domain name with us through our authorized provider. For reasons crucial to maintaining the security, stability, and resilience of the Internet, this includes transferring domain name registration information to the underlying domain registry operator and escrow provider, and disclosing such information as required by ICANN or with other third parties that demonstrate a legitimate interest in such information. \n d. Other important information: This Privacy Policy applies only to Aziende. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Aziende does not own or control, nor to individuals that Aziende does not employ or manage. In addition, some third-party products may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. \n e. Changes: We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so we encourage you to review it periodically. If we make significant changes, we will notify you promptly before those changes become effective. \n If you have questions, suggestions, or would like to file a complaint, please fill out the contact form located on the Aziende website.",
